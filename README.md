# Eclipse Store Presentation

The slides are at [SLIDES.md](SLIDES.md) and can either be viewed in a text
editor of your choosing or by using [presenterm](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/introduction.html).

The example code used for demonstration purposes is located at `./src`.
The setup uses Maven and any JDK22.

Code can be executed like this:

```
mvn -q compile exec:exec
```

You are free to whatever the hell you want with the code and presentation :)
